# ‚ûï Problem: Power of Two

## üìò Problem Statement

> Given an integer `n`, return `true` if it is a power of two. Otherwise, return `false`.  
>  
> An integer `n` is a power of two, if there exists an integer `x` such that `n == 2À£`.

## üß† Python Solutions

---

### üß™ Level 1: Brute Force Multiplication

**Approach:**  
Multiply powers of 2 from `1` to a high enough value and check if any equals `n`.

```python
# Time Complexity: O(log n)
# Space Complexity: O(1)
def isPowerOfTwo(n: int) -> bool:
    if n < 1:
        return False
    power = 1
    while power < n:
        power *= 2
    return power == n
```

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Level 2: Bit Count using bin()

**Approach:**  
A power of two has exactly one bit set in its binary form. Check if `n` > 0 and `bin(n).count('1') == 1`.

```python
# Time Complexity: O(1)
# Space Complexity: O(1)
def isPowerOfTwo(n: int) -> bool:
    return n > 0 and bin(n).count('1') == 1
```

---

### üöÄ Level 3: Bit Manipulation Trick (n & (n - 1) == 0)

**Approach:**  
For powers of two, only one bit is set. Subtracting `1` flips all lower bits. `n & (n - 1)` will be 0 only for powers of two.

```python
# Time Complexity: O(1)
# Space Complexity: O(1)
def isPowerOfTwo(n: int) -> bool:
    return n > 0 and (n & (n - 1)) == 0
```

## üìå Takeaway Points

- Bitwise operations are efficient and elegant for checking power-of-two properties.
- Powers of two always have a single bit set in binary.
- `(n & (n - 1)) == 0` is a common pattern to check for powers of two.
