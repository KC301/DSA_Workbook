# ‚ûï Problem: Merge Intervals

## üìò Problem Statement

> Given an array of `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [start·µ¢, end·µ¢]`, merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

**LeetCode Link:** [56. Merge Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/)

---

```
Example 1:

Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]

Example 2:

Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
```

---

## ‚úÖ Constraints

- `1 <= intervals.length <= 10‚Å¥`
- `intervals[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= start·µ¢ <= end·µ¢ <= 10‚Å¥`

## üß† Python Solutions

### üß™ Level 1: Compare All Pairs (Brute Force)

**Approach:**  
Check each pair of intervals and merge if overlapping. Repeat until no changes occur.

```python
# Time Complexity: O(n¬≤)
# Space Complexity: O(n)
def merge(intervals):
    merged = []
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

    while intervals:
        curr = intervals.pop(0)
        i = 0
        while i < len(intervals):
            if not (curr[1] < intervals[i][0] or curr[0] > intervals[i][1]):
                curr = [min(curr[0], intervals[i][0]), max(curr[1], intervals[i][1])]
                intervals.pop(i)
            else:
                i += 1
        merged.append(curr)
    return merged
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Level 2: Sort and Merge In-Place

**Approach:**  
Sort intervals by start, then merge them as you go.

```python
# Time Complexity: O(n log n)
# Space Complexity: O(n)
def merge(intervals):
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    merged = []

    for interval in intervals:
        if not merged or merged[-1][1] < interval[0]:
            merged.append(interval)
        else:
            merged[-1][1] = max(merged[-1][1], interval[1])
    
    return merged
```

---

### üöÄ Level 3: Optimized In-Place Merge with Preallocation

**Approach:**  
Use the same logic as Level 2 but optimize by modifying the original list if allowed.

```python
# Time Complexity: O(n log n)
# Space Complexity: O(1) if modifying in-place (O(n) if returning new list)
def merge(intervals):
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    index = 0

    for i in range(1, len(intervals)):
        if intervals[index][1] >= intervals[i][0]:
            intervals[index][1] = max(intervals[index][1], intervals[i][1])
        else:
            index += 1
            intervals[index] = intervals[i]

    return intervals[:index + 1]
```

## üìå Takeaway Points

- Sorting by start time simplifies interval merging significantly.
- Efficient merging requires only a single pass post-sort.
- In-place techniques can save space in production environments where memory matters.
