# ‚ûï Problem: Subsets II

## üìò Problem Statement

> Given an integer array `nums` that may contain duplicates, return all possible subsets (the power set).  
> The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.

**LeetCode Link:** [90. Subsets II](https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets-ii/)

---

```
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,2]
Output: [[],[1],[1,2],[1,2,2],[2],[2,2]]

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0]
Output: [[],[0]]
```

---

## ‚úÖ Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10`
- `-10‚Åπ <= nums[i] <= 10‚Åπ`
- `nums[i]` is a unique element in the set.

## üß† Python Solutions

### üß™ Level 1: Brute Force with Sorting and Deduplication

**Approach:**  
Generate all subsets as in Problem 78 and then remove duplicate subsets by sorting and using a set for uniqueness.

```python
# Time Complexity: O(2^n * n log n)
# Space Complexity: O(2^n)
def subsetsWithDup(nums):
    nums.sort()
    result = []
    n = len(nums)
    for i in range(2 ** n):
        subset = []
        for j in range(n):
            if (i >> j) & 1:
                subset.append(nums[j])
        result.append(subset)
    return sorted(result)
```

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Level 2: Backtracking with Deduplication

**Approach:**  
Use backtracking to generate subsets while ensuring that the same subset is not included more than once by checking for duplicates in the recursive calls.

```python
# Time Complexity: O(2^n)
# Space Complexity: O(n)
def subsetsWithDup(nums):
    result = []
    nums.sort()

    def backtrack(start, path):
        result.append(path)
        for i in range(start, len(nums)):
            if i > start and nums[i] == nums[i - 1]:
                continue
            backtrack(i + 1, path + [nums[i]])

    backtrack(0, [])
    return result
```

### üöÄ Level 3: Iterative Approach with Deduplication

**Approach:**  
Iteratively generate subsets and handle duplicates by checking if the current subset is a new combination.

```python
# Time Complexity: O(2^n)
# Space Complexity: O(2^n)
def subsetsWithDup(nums):
    nums.sort()
    result = [[]]
    start = 0
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i - 1]:
            start = len(result)  # Start from the last index to avoid duplicates
        n = len(result)
        for j in range(start, n):
            result.append(result[j] + [nums[i]])
    return result
```
