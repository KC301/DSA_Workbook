# ‚ûï Problem: Kth Smallest Element in a BST

## üìò Problem Statement

> Given a binary search tree, write a function to find the `kth` smallest element in it.  
> Note that the BST is a binary search tree, where for every node, the left subtree‚Äôs values are smaller, and the right subtree‚Äôs values are greater.

```
Example 1:

Input: root = [3,1,4,null,2], k = 1
Output: 1

Example 2:

Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], k = 3
Output: 3
```

## ‚úÖ Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 10‚Å¥]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 10‚Å¥`
- `1 <= k <= The total number of nodes in the tree`

## üß† Python Solutions

### üß™ Level 1: In-order Traversal (Brute Force)

**Approach:**  
Perform an in-order traversal of the BST. Since in-order traversal of a BST gives the elements in sorted order, simply visit the nodes in order and return the `k`th element.

```python
# Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree
# Space Complexity: O(n) for the recursion stack (or O(h) for the iterative approach)
def kthSmallest(root, k):
    def inorder(node):
        if not node:
            return []
        return inorder(node.left) + [node.val] + inorder(node.right)
    
    return inorder(root)[k - 1]
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Level 2: In-order Traversal with Early Termination

**Approach:**  
Same as Level 1, but we terminate early when we've visited `k` elements, avoiding unnecessary work.

```python
# Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree
# Space Complexity: O(h) for recursion stack
def kthSmallest(root, k):
    stack = []
    while True:
        while root:
            stack.append(root)
            root = root.left
        root = stack.pop()
        k -= 1
        if k == 0:
            return root.val
        root = root.right
```

---

### üöÄ Level 3: Optimized Approach with Iterative In-order Traversal

**Approach:**  
Use an iterative in-order traversal to minimize space usage. Only push nodes to the stack until we find the `k`th smallest element.

```python
# Time Complexity: O(h + k), where h is the height of the tree, and k is the number of nodes visited
# Space Complexity: O(h), for the recursion stack or iterative stack
def kthSmallest(root, k):
    stack = []
    while root or stack:
        while root:
            stack.append(root)
            root = root.left
        root = stack.pop()
        k -= 1
        if k == 0:
            return root.val
        root = root.right
```
